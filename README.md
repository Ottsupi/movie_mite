A Movie browsing application in Flutter.

* Bloc
* Clean Architecture

General Guiding Principles
* First make it work, then make it pretty
* Make swapping or adding APIs easy

## Roadmap
- [x] Display list of movies
- [ ] Retrieve the list of movies from a `MovieListRepository` as a stream. 
Because it's cool. Also this will presumably make it easier to store in a cache.
- [ ] Display movie details and store favorite movies locally.
- [ ] Cache browsed movie lists
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Add favorites tagging feature (plan to watch, liked, disliked, etc)
